American_Pale_Ale = """\nAmerican craft beer movement. American Pale ales are golden to deep amber in color, medium-bodied, and have a moderate-to-high hop flavor. Some favorites include Sierra Nevada or Dale's Pale Ale from Oskar Blues. If there were ever a style most representative of classic American craft beer—this would be it. It's one of the most food-friendly beers, so try it with chicken and fish as well as chili or a cheese plate. """

Indian_Pale_Ale = """\nIndian Pale Ale aka "IPA" are the youngest style of the bunch, but probably the most popular in the US today. India Pale Ales are of a color similar (or slightly darker) to that of pale ales, but they have much more concentrated hop aroma and flavor. The style was originally created to survive transport from England to India (hence the name), so additional hops were introduced as a preservative—the oils help keep beer fresh for longer. Imperial IPAs can have up to twice as much malt, hops, and alcohol as a regular IPA. These bad boys clock in at around 7 to 9% ABV, versus the typical 5 to 6 percent. The assertive flavor of IPAs can cut through rich and fatty foods like red meat, cheese, and other strong flavors. """

Stout = """\nThe darkest of beers are stouts, which came about in the early 18th century to describe strong (or "stout") porters. Stout variations include dry stouts (such as Guinness), sweet or milk stouts (made with lactose), oatmeal stouts (made with oatmeal), or American stouts (which taste hoppier than the rest). What unites them all is that they are made with deeply roasted malt, resulting in a dark brown to jet black color, with espresso, unsweetened chocolate, or burnt bread flavors. Try it with soups and stews, roasts, and after dinner as a dessert pairing. """

Wheat_Beer = """\nOn the completely opposite end of the stout spectrum are wheat beers, which also come in a variety of sub-styles. You're likely most familiar with Belgian wheat beers, or "witbiers", which encompass favorites like Blue Moon, Hoegaarden, or Shock Top. Belgian wheat beers have a zesty, orange-citrusy  flavor accented by coriander and other spices, as well as a bright golden color. These lighter, " more herbal beers go great with chicken and fish, salads, pasta and fruit. """

Lager = """\nNow here's where it can get confusing. All beers can be categorized as "ales" and "lagers", so if a beer isn't an ale it's a lager, which is fermented at cooler temperatures by yeast that feasts upon sugar at the bottom of the tank. The most popular in the U.S. is known as-surprise!-American lager, which includes classics like Budweiser or Miller High Life. They're generally pale yellow and translucent with very subtle grain aroma. Most are made with adjuncts—ingredients other than malted barley—such as corn, rice, or oats, and while hop levels are very low, carbonation is very high. They're refreshing and thirst-quenching, perfect for having a few on a hot day. Because they don't have a ton of flavor on their own, crack open a lager with just about any dish. """

Pilsner = """\nPilsner is a specific type of lager that tends to be more flavorful than an American lager. A popular in this category, is Yuengling's Golden Pilsner. The Czech or Bohemian pilsner was first brewed in 1842 in the Czech town of Plzen (get it?). The beer is pale gold and fairly clear, with a picier, more floral hop bouquet than an American lager. It's crisp and refreshing with a complex maltiness, and get its bitterness from noble Czech hops called Saaz hops. The German Pilsner, however, was first brewed following the success of the Bohemian pilsner, about 30 years later. German pilsners such as Bitburger or Warsteiner tend to be lighter in color, crisper, and drier than the Czech Pilsner. Pair a crisp pilsner with chicken, fish, and shortbread. """

Amber_Ale = """\nAmerican Amber Ales —such as New Belgium's Fat Tire— have a maltier, more caramel-forward profile than other pale ales, thanks to the use of caramel and crystal malt that give it a roasted toffee character. They're great for people who like a slightly sweeter beer with a heavier body than your standard pale ale. American hops add a little citrus and pine note to balance it out. The roasted malts go great with barbecue and grilled meat and veggies, so an Amber Ale is right at home at a cookout. """

English_Pale_Ale = """\nThe English pale ale—which includes Boddingtons or Fuller's Chiswick Bitter—has a milder, more malt-forward character than its American counterpart, with a medium to high hoppiness. English yeast gives it a fruity flavor that balances out the bitterness, for a full-flavored pint. You've got to try English Pale Ale with a classic fish and chips, although it tastes great with roast chicken and fish, too. """

Porter = """\nThe line between stout and porter has since become incredibly blurred, with many people using them more or less interchangeably. A typical porter will be dark brown to almost black with a mild hop flavor complemented by notes of unsweetened chocolate, burnt caramel, and sometimes forest fruit. Their complexity lends itself to enjoying a glass alongside prime rib and pork roast, stinky cheeses, and chocolate. """

Sour_Beer = """\nOver the past few years, sour beers – including Sour Monkey and the Salty Gose – have risen in popularity. They taste exactly as they sound, with a tart flavor thanks to lactic acid produced by micoorganisms during fermentation. The level of tartness can vary widely, and many brewers will also add fruit, spice, or other flavors to these unique-tasting beers. Because they have a strong, palate-scrubbing flavor of their own, pair them with funky cheese, creamy foods, or pasta. """

Brown_Ale = """\nNamed for its dark color, the American Brown Ale is a malt-forward, versatile beer that has roasted caramel, chocolate, and toffee flavors and very little hop bitterness. They're inspired by British Brown Ales, but like most American beers, will be more bitter than those. A Brown Ale makes a great introduction to beer for newcomers, and they taste great with just about any cuisine. Try one alongside grilled meat and veggies at your next barbecue."""
